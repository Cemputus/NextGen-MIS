  - "Average Grade (%)"
  - "Amount (UGX)"
  - "Average Attendance (Hours)"
  - "Time Period"

### 4. Payment Tracking
- ✅ Payment timestamps tracked
- ✅ Deadline compliance checking
- ✅ Late penalty calculation

## ⚠️ Notes

### Dependencies
- Python packages need to be installed in virtual environment:
  - flask, flask-cors, flask-jwt-extended
  - sqlalchemy, pymysql, pandas
  - numpy, scikit-learn (for ML models)

### Database
- MySQL database must be running
- Source databases (UCU_SourceDB1) must exist
- Data warehouse (UCU_DataWarehouse) must exist

### Frontend
- Node.js and npm must be installed
- Frontend dependencies must be installed (`npm install`)
- React app can be started with `npm start`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Activate Virtual Environment** (if using one):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   python start_server.py
   # Or
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run ETL Pipeline** (to load data with payment tracking):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python etl_pipeline.py
   ```

## ✅ System Status: READY

All components are properly configured and ready to run. The system includes:
- Complete payment tracking with deadline compliance
- Role-based analytics and visualizations
- UCU branding throughout
- Proper axis labels and units
- Comprehensive error handling

The system is ready for testing and deployment.
